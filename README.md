This project is a course assignment focused on building a multiplayer game using Unity 3D and Unity's official services. The game leverages Relay to establish serverless communication between players, Netcode for GameObject to handle real-time networking for game objects, and Lobby for player matchmaking and room creation. The entire project is developed in C# and showcases the implementation of multiplayer functionalities in a seamless and engaging gaming experience.
